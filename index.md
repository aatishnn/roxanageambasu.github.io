title: Overview

I am an assistant professor of Computer Science Department at Columbia University. I am interested in computer systems in a broad sense, including distributed systems, security and privacy, operating systems, and databases. My current research aims to understand what privacy means in today's data-driven world, and build systems that help increase it.  I believe that a new definition is needed for privacy in a world where data protection and access prevention are no longer attainable.  I do not yet know what the new definition for privacy should be, but I believe that it should include at least three concepts: **accountability**, **fairness**, and **responsible data management**.  Read about research to increase privacy in today's data-driven world [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/01-research/).

### Short Bio

I joined Columbia in Fall 2011 after finishing her Ph.D. at the University of
Washington.  For my work in cloud and mobile data privacy, I received a
Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship, a ``Brilliant 10'' Popular Science nomination, an NSF CAREER award (all in 2014); an Honorable Mention for the inaugural Dennis M. Ritchie Doctoral Dissertation Award in 2013, a William Chan Dissertation Award in 2012, two best paper awards at top systems conferences (2009 and 2011), and the first Google Ph.D. Fellowship in Cloud Computing (2009).  I did my undergraduate studies in my home country, Romania, at the Polytechnic University of Bucharest.

I am now part of the [Columbia Software Systems Lab](http://systems.cs.columbia.edu/), an energetic group of professors and students working on highly relevant challenges in today's cutting-edge technologies, such as mobile devices, cloud computing, and distributed systems.

### My Students

I am extremely fortunate to supervise a set of wonderful Ph.D. students:

* [Vaggelis Atlidakis](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~vatlidak/)
* [Mathias Lecuyer](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mathias/) (co-advising with [Augustin Chaintreau](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~augustin/))
* [Riley Spahn](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~riley/) (co-advising with [Gail
  Kaiser](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kaiser/))
* Giannis Spiliopoulos
* [Nicolas Viennot](https://github.com/nviennot) (principal advisor is [Jason
  Nieh](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nieh/))

Other great student collaborators (current or past):
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://jonbell.net">Jonathan Bell</a>, Ph.D. student</li>
    <li>Sravan Bhamidipati, M.S., now at [Knewton](http://www.knewton.com/)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ty/">Yang Tang</a>, Ph.D. student</li>
</ul>


### Student Recruiting

**I am looking for new Ph.D. students, as well as Columbia project students.**
If you are a highly motivated person, you have solid coding experience
(particularly systems building experience), and you are interested in
doing distributed systems research, please email me your resume and
tell me about your research interests.

I am **not** looking for interns or other short-term visitors.
So please do not contact me about such opportunities, unless I have
explicitly contacted you, your advisor, or your school.


### MS Advising
